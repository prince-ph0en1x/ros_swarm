ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot.
It provides the services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.
It also provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing, and running code across multiple computers.

One of the basic goals of ROS is to enable roboticists to design software as a collection of small, mostly independent programs.
A running instance of a ROS program is called a node.
If we execute multiple copies of the same program at the same time, each uses a different node name.
